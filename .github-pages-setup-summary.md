# Setup Summary - What Was Done

## The Problem
You wanted to render your Jekyll site locally to test changes before deploying, without installing Ruby/Jekyll system-wide.

## The Solution
Complete Docker/Podman containerization with helper scripts.

## What Persists Between Sessions

### ✓ Will be there when you come back:
- **Docker Image** (`jekyll-site`) - The complete Ruby + Jekyll environment (~1.2 GB)
- **All your files** - Source code, content, configuration
- **Helper scripts** - `setup.sh`, `jekyll.sh`
- **Documentation** - All the .md files

### ✗ Won't persist (but easily recreated):
- **Running container** - Stops when you log out/reboot
  - Solution: Just run `./setup.sh` or `./jekyll.sh start`
- **Generated site** (`_site/`) - Rebuilt each time
- **Cache** (`.jekyll-cache/`) - Recreated as needed

## When You Come Back

**Simplest way:**
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script:
1. Checks if Podman is installed ✓
2. Checks if the Docker image exists (builds it if not)
3. Checks if the server is running (starts it if not)
4. Reports the URL: http://localhost:4000

**If you prefer manual control:**
```bash
./jekyll.sh start    # Start server
./jekyll.sh stop     # Stop server
./jekyll.sh status   # Check status
./jekyll.sh logs     # View logs
```

## What Each File Does

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Dockerfile` | Recipe to build the Jekyll environment |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Alternative way to run (not required) |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes files from Docker build |
| `setup.sh` | Automated setup checker and starter |
| `jekyll.sh` | Server management commands |
| `README.md` | Quick start instructions |
| `DEVELOPMENT.md` | Detailed documentation |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Quick reference card |

## Typical Workflow After Coming Back

1. Open terminal in project directory
2. Run: `./setup.sh`
3. Wait ~5-10 seconds for Jekyll to build
4. Open browser: http://localhost:4000
5. Edit files - changes auto-refresh!
6. Done? Run: `./jekyll.sh stop`

## If Things Go Wrong

**Image was deleted?**
```bash
podman build -t jekyll-site .  # Rebuilds in 2-3 minutes
```

**Container in weird state?**
```bash
podman rm -f jekyll-server
./jekyll.sh start
```

**Complete reset?**
```bash
podman rm -f jekyll-server
podman rmi jekyll-site
rm -rf _site .jekyll-cache Gemfile.lock
podman build -t jekyll-site .
./jekyll.sh start
```

## No Ruby Installed!

That's the point! Everything is in the container:
- Ruby 3.3.10
- Jekyll 3.10.0
- All 98 gem dependencies
- Build tools

Your system remains clean. ✨

## File Changes Summary

**New files created:**
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition
- `docker-compose.yml` - Compose file (optional)
- `.dockerignore` - Build exclusions
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup
- `jekyll.sh` - Management script
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Full documentation
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference
- This summary file

**Modified files:**
- `README.md` - Added local development section
- `Gemfile.lock` - DELETED (will be regenerated by container)

**What happens with Gemfile.lock:**
- The container generates it during build
- Gets created in the container's bundle cache
- Local one will be regenerated when you run Jekyll
- This is normal and expected!
