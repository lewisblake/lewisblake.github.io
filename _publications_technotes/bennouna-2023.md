## Abstract
As one of the service products, CAMS is currently producing a global reanalysis of reactive trace gases, greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations (Inness et al., 2019). The production of the reanalysis has started early 2017, and the period 2003-2022 was completed in January 2023. The CAMS reanalysis will be further extended in the years up to 2024. This document presents the validation results for the 20-year reanalysis run, 2003 - 2022, focussing on aerosols and reactive gases.
