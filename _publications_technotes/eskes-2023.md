## Abstract
This report reports on the evaluation of the upgrade of the CAMS global system of June 2023. Before each upgrade, the new model and assimilation configuration is operated in parallel (the e-suite) to the operational real-time service (the o-suite) for about half a year. In the report a set of quick-look validation results are presented from a comparison of the performance of the e-suite runs with the operational o-suite and independent observations. The main conclusions are listed, and the evidence for these findings is presented in the form of a series of plots comparing e-suite, o-suite and independent observations.
