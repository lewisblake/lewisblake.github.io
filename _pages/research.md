## Current Work
I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at [Statkraft](https://www.statkraft.com/), developing software solutions for hydropower operations and energy trading. My work involves developing systems which collect, process, and curate weather, hydrological, and climate data sets.

Previously, I worked on climate and air pollution modeling projects at the [Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway)](https://www.met.no/), where I developed machine learning-based air pollution forecasting models and contributed to the development of the Python package [pyaerocom](https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/) for air quality model evaluation.

## PhD Project
My research focused on developing spatial statistical tools to analyze massive spatial data. The environmental data sets I worked with range from hundreds-of-thousands up to hundreds-of-millions of observations. Traditional statistical methods are computationally infeasible for the typical data sizes now generated by remote sensing instruments and numerical models. Moreover, even if computations were feasible, common modeling practices can hinder the scientific utility of these data by imposing unrealistic assumptions. I developed theoretical and practical tools to analyze these data in a computationally efficient manner and capture complex spatial relationships.

## Research Interests
- Spatial statistics
