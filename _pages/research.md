## Present Research
I currently work on a variety of projects at the Norwegian Meterological Institue (MET Norway), including development of the Python package [pyaerocom](https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/) and evaluation of air pollution and climate models.

## PhD Project
My research focused on developing spatial statistical tools to analyze massive spatial data. The environmental data sets I worked with range from hundreds-of-thousands up to hundreds-of-millions of observations. Traditional statistical methods are computationally infeasible for the typical data sizes now generated by remote sensing instruments and numerical models. Moreover, even if computations were feasible, common modeling practices can hinder the scientific utility of these data by imposing unrealistic assumptions. I developed theoretical and practical tools to analyze these data in a computationally efficient manner and capture complex spatial relationships.

## Research Interests
- Spatial statistics
- Machine learning
- High performance computing
- Earth sciences including oceanography, atmospheric science, and climate
