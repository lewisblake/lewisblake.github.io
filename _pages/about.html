    <p>Hi, I'm Lewis. I am a Computational Scientist in the Division For Climate Modeling and Air Pollution at the <a href="https://www.met.no" title="https://www.met.no">Norwegian Meterological Institute</a> in Oslo. My work is primarily in climate and air pollution model evaluation. I contribute to the Python package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/" title="https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/">pyaerocom</a> and the <a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/" title="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/">European CAMS project</a>.

    <p> I completed my PhD in Statistics from the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/" title="https://ams.mines.edu/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a href="https://www.mines.edu/" title="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a>, USA in December 2021. My thesis foucsed on developing spatial statistics tools for analyzing massive spatial data sets to study the Earth system. A primary component of my PhD was as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/" title="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> in Boulder, Colorado, USA. There I developed and released scalable machine learning models which allow users to compute with hundreds-of-millions of observations and reduced computation times by 75%.</p>
