  <p>Hi, I'm Lewis. I am a Computational Scientist in the Division For Climate Modeling and Air Pollution at the <a
      href="https://www.met.no" title="https://www.met.no">Norwegian Meterological Institute</a> in Oslo. My work is
    primarily in climate and air pollution model evaluation. I contribute to the Python package <a
      href="https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/" title="https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/">pyaerocom</a> and the <a
      href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/" title="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/">European CAMS project</a>.

  <p> I completed my PhD in Statistics from the <a href="https://ams.mines.edu/"
      title="https://ams.mines.edu/">Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</a> at <a
      href="https://www.mines.edu/" title="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a>, USA in December 2021.
    My <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11124/15362" title="https://hdl.handle.net/11124/15362">thesis</a> foucsed on
    developing spatial statistics tools for analyzing massive spatial data sets to study the Earth
    system. A primary component of my PhD was as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/"
      title="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a> in Boulder, Colorado, USA.
    There I developed and released scalable machine learning models which allow users to compute with
    hundreds-of-millions of observations and reduced computation times by 75%.</p>

  <p> Prior to that, I completed my undergaduate studies concentrating in mathematics, computer science, and agriculture
    at <a href="https://hampshire.edu/" title="https://hampshire.edu/">Hampshire College</a> in Amherst, Massachusetts,
    USA.</p>
