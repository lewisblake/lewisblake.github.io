Hi, I'm Lewis. My background is in statistics, machine learning, and optimization. 

I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at [Statkraft](https://www.statkraft.com/), Europe's largest renewable energy company, where I develop software solutions for energy managment. Previously, I worked as a Computational Scientist at the [Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway)](https://www.met.no/), where I developed machine learning-based air pollution forecasting models and contributed to air quality and climate model evaluation, and uncertainty quantification. During that time, I developed features for the Python package [pyaerocom](https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/) and contributed to the [European CAMS project](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) and [CAMEO](https://www.cameo-project.eu/).

I completed my PhD in Statistics from the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) in December 2021. My [thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/11124/15362) developed computational and theoretical tools for analyzing massive nonstationary spatial data sets. A primary component of my PhD was as a Research Assistant at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) in Boulder, Colorado. There I developed and released scalable machine learning models which allow users to compute with hundreds-of-millions of observations and reduced computation times by 75%.

Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies concentrating in mathematics, computer science, and agriculture at [Hampshire College](https://hampshire.edu/) in Amherst, Massachusetts.
