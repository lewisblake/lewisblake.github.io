Hi, I'm Lewis. My background is in statistics, machine learning, and optimization. 

I currently work as a Senior Software Developer at [Statkraft](https://www.statkraft.com/), Europe's largest renewable energy company, where I develop data-driven systems for energy management and trading. Previously, I worked as a Computational Scientist at the [Norwegian Meteorological Institute](https://www.met.no/), developing machine learning-based forecasting models and contributing to the [European CAMS project](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) and [CAMEO](https://www.cameo-project.eu/).

I completed my PhD in Statistics from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) in December 2021, focusing on scalable algorithms for massive spatial datasets. As a Research Assistant at [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), I developed parallel computing methods that reduced computation times by 75% for datasets with hundreds-of-millions of observations.

I hold a B.A. from [Hampshire College](https://hampshire.edu/) concentrating in Mathematics and Computer Science.
