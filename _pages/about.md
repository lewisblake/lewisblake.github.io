Hi, I'm Lewis. I am a Computational Scientist in the Division For Climate Modeling and Air Pollution at the [Norwegian Meterological Institute](https://www.met.no/) in Oslo. My work is in climate and air pollution model evaluation and uncertainity quantification. I contribute to the Python package [pyaerocom](https://pypi.org/project/pyaerocom/), which offers a powerful and flexible framework for comparing models against observations and is used extensively throughout our projects. I additionally manage and contribute to contracts for the [European CAMS project](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) for air quality model evaluation and uncertainty quantification.

I completed my PhD in Statistics from the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) in December 2021. My [thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/11124/15362) developed computational and theoretical tools for analyzing massive nonstationary spatial data sets. A primary component of my PhD was as a Research Assistant at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) in Boulder, Colorado. There I developed and released scalable machine learning models which allow users to compute with hundreds-of-millions of observations and reduced computation times by 75%.

Prior to that, I completed my undergaduate studies concentrating in mathematics, computer science, and agriculture at [Hampshire College](https://hampshire.edu/) in Amherst, Massachusetts.
